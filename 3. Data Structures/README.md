### Array

`Array` is a simply collection of object for things, they are very powerful data structures that store list of elements and they have endless application.

Simple examples can be a collection of books on our table, clothes in our wardrobe and pens in our pens stack.

Characteristics of Array
* Array can store data of specified type

> Once you have defined the type of data for every other mass must be the same type of the data that we defined

* Elements of an array are located in a contiguous 
* Each element of an array has a unique index
* The size of an array is predefined and cannot be modified.
> When we create an area, we define its capacity so we can not change it later. This is the biggest limitation of array.

#### What is an Array?
In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that hte position of each element can be computed from its index by a mathematical formula.

> Based on these indexes, we can find any element and do any mathematical calculation on them.

#### Why do we need an Array?

So in software programs, the array is used almost everywhere in the program to store any data.
