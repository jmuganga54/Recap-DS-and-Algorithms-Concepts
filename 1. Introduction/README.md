> What are the Data Structures
>> Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer that can be used effectively.
> Example: Let say we have a bunch of words here.

>> And it can be easily seen that they are not organized. So if you want to choose a black color of wood, you would face a problem here?
> We need to check all of them one by one and to find out the black one, since these items are not in organize way, selecting black one is time consuming and difficult.

> Ok Let's look at the organized view of these items.
![Organized Items](./img/organized_rules.png)
> What have we done here?
>> We have just taken the unorganized items and put them in an organized way, so selecting a Black wood from these list is very easy and it takes less time to find it. You can obviously see that it is at a certain position.

> So when it comes to data structures, we are doing the same thing that we have done here, organizing the items, it is very clear that all softwares are dealing with data.So they do some operations based on given data, before processing the data we have to organize data in a certain way that makes the process very efficient.
From software application performance point of view, the efficiency and the performance of software depends on how the data is stored, organized and grouped together during programming execution.

Everyday during our daily lives, we can see various types of data structures, there might be a crowd of people who want to get a ticket from the concert, but without organized way, it becomes almost impossible to get tickets.The organized way to people to get tickets it is a `queue`, it is also called `queue` data structure in computer science, which is first in, first out, as you see from the picture.

As you can see on the picture the person who came first by the ticket first.So this is called First in, first out in  computer 
Science.

> Another example is imagine there's a bunch of books on the table and you want to return them to the library.

It's obvious that without organized way of ordering, we cannot carry these books.On the other hand, if you order them in this way, it becomes easier to carry them.And this reminds us `stack` data structures in computer science.

Ok, we understand that we use data structure to make our application very efficient, but the problem is that there are many different types of data structures. So which one should we choose for the best performance of software or app?. You will find that answer to this question throughout this course while explaining all data structures and their use cases.

And this is the main reason why big companies like Google, Apple, Amazon or Facebook ask questions about data structures and algorithms from the candidates during their interview process, a professional software developer has to know which data structure to choose for a particular app, which has a direct effect on the performance.
